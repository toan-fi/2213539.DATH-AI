I first saw Fight Club when I was 8 years old. I didn't understand any of it, but I liked the fighting and editing.the film is a fire.
So rewatchable. The acting is amazing, the story is amazing the second time you watch it, very good acting, funny as well sometimes. Great movie.
The comparison to Clockwork Orange makes me puke
I have no words about this film. This is masterpiece cult film.
Most overrated POS on the top 250
